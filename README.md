Odin project - Snake game using javascript/jQuery

<pre>
!!!decided to change nature of the game based on how it's evolved: you CAN cross your own path, hazards are the spikes and flames

-keep tweaking visuals









-currently can sort of 'pause' the game by hitting any button other than arrows...leave it for now, but will have to fix in the end

-add reset button and pause button

-speed depends on level (once i figure out how to speed it up properly)
(while loop around setinterval...if certain condition, clearinterval then loop and run setinterval again with new speed)

-fix it so new elements can't appear in already occupied grid space?

-new element at high levels: pit? (reduces you to just head)

-use localstorage to store high score! (very easy)

-add endgame code (you died, your score vs highscore, play again, blah blah blah)

-add legend/instructions/about
