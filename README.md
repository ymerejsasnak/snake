snake
=====

Odin project - Snake game using javascript/jQuery

<pre>
-snake doesn't die if it only has one body segment other than the head and doubles back on itself (they just swap, is this ok?)

-need to speed up as it goes along

-keep tweaking visuals










-fix it so new food (or whatever) can't appear in already occupied grid space


-maybe make more fruit appear the longer the game goes on (instead of just one at a time)


?-add more unusual features like other items that do different things (affect speed, just points, walls, moving enemies, etc.)
-maybe change to health function where you eat enough food to 'level up' and THEN you grow (then can have bad things make you lose health or segment or whatever)



numbers plan:

needed experience to get to next level === current level
levelup adds a segment
score gained depends on level and number of segments and type of scoring item
max health depends on level and segments?
