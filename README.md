snake
=====

Odin project - Snake game using javascript/jQuery

<pre>
-snake doesn't die if it only has one body segment other than the head and doubles back on itself (they just swap, is this ok?)
(possible alternate solutions:  start with 3 body sections...or start with at least 2 and don't allow backwards direction)

-keep tweaking visuals










-fix it so new elements can't appear in already occupied grid space


-maybe make more fruit appear the longer the game goes on (instead of just one at a time)


element ideas:
food (gain experience and points)
health item (refill life and get points)
just score (just gives various amounts of points)
stationary bad cells (lava, spikes, whatever)
  -variations: lose health, lose segment, die
moving enemies (same variations as above)
powerup that lets you eat an enemy or survive stationary bad elements?



numbers plan:

needed experience to get to next level === current level
levelup adds a segment
score gained depends on level and number of segments and type of scoring item
max health depends on level and segments?
speed depends on level (once i figure out how to speed it up properly)
number and type of elements that appears depends on level
