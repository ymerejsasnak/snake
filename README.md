=====

Odin project - Snake game using javascript/jQuery

<pre>
-fix it so new food (or whatever) can't appear in already occupied grid space

-keep score

-adjust speed (start slower, but speed up as game goes on) (snake has speed property, but how do I change it in setInterval??)

-maybe make more fruit appear the longer the game goes on (instead of just one at a time)

?-add more unusual features like other items that do different things (affect speed, just points, walls, moving enemies, etc.)
-maybe change to health function where you eat enough food to 'level up' and THEN you grow (then can have bad things make you lose health or segment or whatever)

-make it so divs are styled based on grid contents rather than just using text characters (css already exists for this in snake.css)
-or follow odin directions and change them to images?? (prob not)

-adjust overall look (css mostly) of the game
