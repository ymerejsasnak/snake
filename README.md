snake
=====

Odin project - Snake game using javascript/jQuery

<pre>
-snake doesn't die if it only has one body segment other than the head and doubles back on itself (they just swap, is this ok?)
(possible alternate solutions:  start with 3 body sections...or start with at least 2 and don't allow backwards direction)

-keep tweaking visuals

-currently can sort of 'pause' the game by hitting any button other than arrows...leave it for now, but will have to fix in the end


-add reset button and pause button

-speed depends on level (once i figure out how to speed it up properly)


-fix it so new elements can't appear in already occupied grid space?



element ideas:

higher levels- bottomless pit (die)
moving enemies? (same variations as above)
powerup that lets you eat an enemy or survive stationary bad elements?
