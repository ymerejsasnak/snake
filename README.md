#Hey, Kitty!  Don't step on the spikes!
(began life as the snake game project from Odin Project)

like traditional snake game (eat food to grow) but in this you can cross your path (it's just your paw prints after all!) and the hazards come in the form of spikes that are randomly added to the game as you grow (which will remove one paw not end the game).




###TODO:



-add reset button and pause button?


-use localstorage to store high score (and high level and high length)! (very easy)


-add endgame code (you died, your score vs highscore, play again, blah blah blah)


-add basic legend/instructions/about
