#Hey, Kitty!  Don't step on the spikes!
(began life as the snake game project from Odin Project)

like traditional snake game (eat food to grow) but in this you can cross your path (it's just your paw prints after all!) and the hazards come in the form of spikes that are randomly added to the game as you grow (which will remove one paw not end the game).




###TO DO:
* clean up messy non-robust code
* improve display/visuals
* address any cross-browser/responsive design type of issues
* add basic legend/instructions/about
* improve newgame code to handle reset programmatically rather than just reloading the whole page
