Odin project - Snake game using javascript/jQuery

<pre>
!!!decided to change nature of the game based on how it's evolved: you CAN cross your own path, hazards are the spikes and flames

-keep tweaking visuals









-currently can sort of 'pause' the game by hitting any button other than arrows...leave it for now, but will have to fix in the end


-add reset button and pause button


-fix it so new elements can't appear in already occupied grid space?


-use localstorage to store high score (and high level and high length)! (very easy)


-add endgame code (you died, your score vs highscore, play again, blah blah blah)


-add legend/instructions/about
